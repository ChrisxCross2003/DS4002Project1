This theater is owned currently owned by the Texas Elevate Entertainment Group from Texas, purchased in October, 2023.  The Violent Crown Cinema was opened in 2010. It‚Äôs been renovated into more of a cafe/pub scene. Hey, their beer list üç∫ much more than Miller, Bud, Coors . . . a more expensive craft selection of beersüòÉüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºMovie tickets & seats selected on line if you wish . Not many folks in our theater showing Conclave . . . My wife loved her buttered popcorn. Made fresh! I sampled the Port City  Porter ( 7% alc.) and decided on the Aleworks Tavern Brown Ale üç∫ ( flavored with caramel, dash of chocolate, nuts, at 6.2% alc. ). Very good beer üòÉüëçüèºwith a large soft & heated pretzel & stone ground mustard !  Stadium seating, comfortable leather chairs , with cup holders!

Violet Crown,11/15/2024,Donna DeLoria,FALSE,5,"A big thank you to the Violet Crown! The staff was super friendly, professional, and accommodating after a sudden (and very badly timed) storm took out the electricity for half of downtown just before the Wicked early access showtime last night. We were attending with family who had already driven in from Richmond, and were so disappointed to arrive to a dark theater.  But the staff let us come into the restaurant space and assured us they were committed to showing the movie if the power came back on.  In the end, we had a fun time waiting (with fingers crossed) and ultimately got to see a great movie and enjoy fresh popcorn!"

Violet Crown,10/15/2024,Kyle O'Hara,FALSE,4,"Seats are worn but new seats are being installed and we're staged when we went. Food was meh and over priced but that's a movie theater for you.  Overall, I'd go again"
Violet Crown,9/15/2024,Kenny Roston,TRUE,4,"Went here to check out a movie that wasn't playing anywhere else. It is a positive to have a local theater that shows independent films. The screen, sound, and picture quality is great. One thing that stood out that could need improvement is the theater we were in was the chairs were very worn, but was comfortable."

Violet Crown,10/15/2023,Scott,TRUE,2,Dirty theater with the most rickety seats I've ever heard. The cup holders had mold in them and every time someone moved in their seats its the loudest creaking.Plus theater 2 is right next to the station where all the employees chat.

Violet Crown,8/15/2023,Nicholas Bradsher,FALSE,5,"When I first went back to a movie theater after COVID restrictions lifted, I had such a terrible time at a Regal theater that I was pretty ready to swear off theaters besides Alamo. I‚Äôm so glad I found Violet Crown, as I‚Äôve had an excellent experience every single time I‚Äôve gone there.The picture is clear, the sound is great, and the snacks are tasty. I think their specialty beers are really cool, and I‚Äôve liked the selection of films they‚Äôve chosen aside from new releases. My wife and I especially enjoyed the ‚ÄúMy Film Series According to Rock Band‚Äù series.Honestly, the reason I choose VC more than anywhere else if the staff. Every person I‚Äôve met has been professional and friendly."

It is because the seats are so large and luxurious, reclining, with tabletops that include cup holders.

Quaint intimate and not crowded. Definitely a place you want to visit occasionally."

I'd far rather leave a positive review for something I really enjoyed. Also, I have never, but never returned food... ever. But sadly, I returned my food here... twice, same night. Really, if you're going to charge double the going rate for a hot dog with ketchup, the recipe is not difficult. This was just awful - twice.1) take those dogs out of the rotisserie on a regular schedule. (When it's done, it's done. It doesn't get better by leaving it in thirty minutes longer.)2) throw out the ones that haven't sold, don't expect a different outcome by serving up a second rubbery-hard hotdog out of the same rotisserie fifteen minutes later, and3) do not put it on a stale bun straight out of the fridge - twice.OH! And when I returned the second hot dog at the end of the movie, sans the side of fries, because I was starving, they refunded me... for the dog only. And that put it over the top."

But the Violet Crown is my favorite of the three. Why? Because the Violet Crown is all about the movies. Having been here for two seasons of movies, I can tell you there are very few films that don't make an appearance here.  Any given year, you can catch blockbusters, indie movies, Oscar movies, documentaries, and older movies they decide to put back in theaters. I had one of my favorite movie theater experiences ever watching the 2017 Oscar Nominated Animated Short Films screening. One of the reasons being that the rest of the audience was so respectful of everyone else and yet clearly having a good time watching the show. You can't ask for more.Add on to that a good food selection, a great beer selection, seats you can book online in advance, and a friendly and helpful staff and you have a terrific theater going experience. Treat yourself to a show at the Violet Crown!"

Many other disappointing experiences (loud, squeaky seats disrupting quiet moments, cold coffee, rude, drunk patrons not respecting theatre etiquette, etc.) that make me wonder why I ever come back (lack of options in Charlottesville for film screenings, perhaps?).

While 2 movie tickets and a large soda costs about $15 back in Ohio (with motorized RECLINING leather seats, which this theater does not have) the same thing costs about $35 here. That's just a symptom of being in Charlottesville, I know, but it's verging on the point where dinner might end up being cheaper than seeing a movie. Either way, I'm glad I bought a moviepass, because seeing one movie a month here already makes up the subscription cost. It's a good theater, but those prices are something else."

The price is too high for the experience if you ask me.   They claim to have two bars, but neither serve liquor- only beer and wine. I did like that the theatre was smaller and the seats where comfortable. If you sit front row they recline! All in all ok, but I wouldn't be excited to visit again.  $60 for two people and that didn't include any food is OVERPRICED.  Especially with how easy it is to rent movies over the internet for nominal fees, and how quickly movies become available.   Do yourself a favor and go to a nice dinner on the downtown mall instead.  I guarantee you'll feel like you're getting more out of your money....Unless you're on a date and they're paying.  Then go for it!"

The beer selection is great and changes every so often. They serve food as well but I haven't tried it.Violet Crown offers mostly blockbusters or bigger independent movies. They have showings of more obscure or foreign movies, sometimes shown as a series around a theme (great French movie series last summer) but it's mostly about big movies."

Violet Crown,11/15/2017,cday34,FALSE,5,Small but quite comfortable. The perfect drinking theatre as they have a plethora of craft brews and some wine for those connoisseurs. There are theatre prices but that is to be expected. The seats are really comfortable with a table in each one so you can eat or set your drink. We go there every week.

Violet Crown,10/15/2017,Matt Frierdich,TRUE,4,"Really enjoyed going here (caveat, tickets were bought for my wife and me as part of a promotion). The theater is in a great location, easy to make it part of a date or just a fun night out. The seating was comfortable, but not as clean as I would expect. Staff seemed pretty hands off: had to track down 3D glasses ourselves, the 3D projection was set up correctly for start of film, did not tell my wife when she bought a beer about pending happy hour pricing (it would have been cheaper if she had waited 5 minutes). These are very small things, it was a really great place we would go again. But the small things make the difference when deciding between somewhere like The Alamo or even Regal. Overall, I recommend!"

Can bring purchases food and drink inside the theater with you. Seats have slide out tables for the food.Surprising discovery was that the gluten-free pizza crust is actually better than the regular pizza crust.And update after 8 months. Taking off two stars for food quality. It‚Äôs gone significantly downhill. Here‚Äôs a pic of a $12 personal pizza for an example"

They even have gluten free pizza crusts available for their pizzas. The truffled fries are delicious too! Every theater seat has a tray so that you are able to enjoy your food and beverages while watching your flick. (Tip: large popcorns get free refills) Violet Crown also hosts a weekly ""Industry Night"" for those in the food service industry (pay stubs required, for details contact them...

You get the opportunity to reserve seats for a theater that is typically much smaller than the ones we've become accustomed to. But they have all new technology so the picture and sound is great. There is also an attached restaurant and bar so if you want to take food or beer or wine into the movie you are more than welcome to. One of the other great things is that with parking being a hassle on the downtown mall, you can park at the parking garage and get your parking receipt validated at the theater!"

First cinema in C-ville to serve cocktails and food in-theater, although with the imminent opening of Alamo Drafthouse there will be competition. VC screens a smattering of art-house films, filling a gap left by the Vinegar Hill Theatre, still mourned in these parts. Leave a little time to park and walk to VC before showtime; parking can be dicey downtown. On the upside, they'll validate your parking ticket if you use one of the garages."

Everyone respectful, no talking or on cell phones (they are strict on that and will have you removed). We live walking distance but they provide parking vouchers for Water St. garage. A couple upcoming movies that we want to see, Violet Crown has a variety of great movies always, not your typical commercialized movies . You can pre-order tickets online or when you get to theater. Tickets not overpriced for quality and extra bonuses you get.Looking forward to seeing more movies there, would be awesome if showed Bully Fighters movie"
Violet Crown,6/15/2016,Neal Morgan,TRUE,5,Great affordable movies. Super comfortable couch like seating. Great for a date before or after a nice walk along the street. Food and drinks are expensive.

The first 2 hours the H/A  pumped below freezing outside air into the theater, then ten minutes of heated air, followed by a return to very cold air. Everyone in theater had to put on heavy coats, hats and gloves.  The desks answer to this horrible situation was ‚Äú They needed to keep the projector cool‚Äù.

Violet Crown,11/15/2015,ziv haskal,FALSE,3,"First time at theater to see Star Wars in 3D, center seats. Both of us felt that something was off in the projection. The 3D was a bit 'blurry,' distracting because of some distortion, etc-- and we both independently wished we had seen the non-3D version, in hopes that these issues might have been absent. Sound should have been louder for the overtures, music, etc. Screen (and 3D effect and projection) are simply better represented at Regal Stonefield.I suppose I'd give the theater another try for a 'smaller' movie, where screen size and projection are not so as paramount.  For this particular movie, it was a real disappointment."

Many of the beer and wine selections are local and all are on tap - so they're always fresh. The food is great, the service is friendly, and the prices are affordable. For the price of sodas, popcorn and candy at a standard movie theater, we were able to enjoy two drinks each + a hot dog and pizza. The seating is very comfortable and the audio/visual components are up to par with other ""big name"" theaters. We'll be seeing movies here from now on!!"
Violet Crown,7/15/2015,Patrick Schuermann,FALSE,5,"Great beer and wine list (not just for a theatre). Food was solid (ten times better than you will find at any other theatre).

Violet Crown,7/15/2015,Matt Ellenburg,TRUE,5,"Didn't see a movie, but the bar was very nice.  Lots of beers on tap including local offerings.

The thing that will keep me from coming back is the awful drinks! $13 for bottom of the bottom shelf 6 oz ""cocktail"" which they should at least advertise it's bottom shelf and offer you the option for premium. Sooo disappointed with that part of the experience which at first I was expecting to be the highlight. Olive garden has better quality drinks lol"

Unfortunately, this location felt dated compared to others I‚Äôve been to around the country. The theater itself wasn‚Äôt as clean as I‚Äôd expect‚Äîthe floor was sticky, and the seats were noticeably worn. Additionally, the seats didn‚Äôt fully recline like other Alamo Drafthouse locations, which was disappointing.On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the sound quality during the movie was excellent, which definitely enhanced the overall viewing experience. However, given the condition of the theater and the lack of cleanliness, I would think twice before returning to this particular location. Hopefully, some updates and improvements are on the horizon for this venue."

Whether it‚Äôs bringing your order directly to your seat or providing friendly service, they go above and beyond to create a great atmosphere.The food is a standout feature‚Äîit‚Äôs not your typical movie theater fare. From creative appetizers to satisfying entrees, everything is delicious and fresh. Pair it with a craft beer or specialty drink, and you‚Äôve got the perfect movie night.What really sets Alamo apart are their themed movie parties.

We recently attended the moana 2 party and were so surprised when we arrived to activities and little gifts. This was such a fun addition to the viewing experience. The food is pretty good for a dining movie theatre and I love that they do bottomless popcorn and drinks. My only small critique is that the seats are not the most comfortable and not all the seats recline. If they had updated seats and recliners for all chairs this would be a 5 star for me. Overall though would definitely recommend over any of the other movie theaters in charlottesville.
Alamo Drafthouse,12/15/2024,Caleb Stone,TRUE,5,Wow! I cannot say enough great things about our experience. I cannot believe I had not heard of this place sooner. We drove from Lynchburg and it was worth the drive. The food is delish and high quality and about the same price as eating out anywhere. The service was impeccable with courteous wait staff. Endless popcorn and free refills on drinks! The recliner chairs were super comfy and the sound quality and picture of the screen were great. We will definitely be coming back!

Since getting the pass last year I‚Äôve seen 32+ movies. I‚Äôve enjoyed being able to re-watch movies I loved and see movies I would never have paid full price for without a second thought. I often just pop in after work for a show by myself. I love their appetizers and always look forward to their food. I feel very comfortable and safe coming here alone to watch movies, it‚Äôs quickly become my favorite pastime in Charlottesville. I also appreciate the decorations and various movie specials. For example, I saw the Mamma Mia showing on Mother‚Äôs Day a few years ago and it was so fun. It was cheesy to be dancing with glow sticks, sure, but a memory I‚Äôll never forget!"

Alamo Drafthouse,9/15/2024,Bumpass Truckin,TRUE,1,"When the server brought my drink out nearly 30 min after bringing my daughters, he requested a card.  I gave him my black visa, which he charged almost at the end of the movie, finally brings the bill out and literally slaps it on the table while walking by. I sign it. And nobody returns to collect it, nor did they return my card.  After getting the run around until I was well passed upset, the manager that I finally was led to, said they looked for it, claimed they would call me the next day or if it was found, tomorrow marks 2 weeks, the card still missing, and the managers still haven't called. Go figure.  And to make it worse, I wasn't the only one they lost a card for, as the same , backpeddling,  excuse making, circle jerk of a manager, comes back offering me a dude named Jacob's card, like bro, there's not even a j in my name.   If I could rate that place in the negative, I certainly would, daddy daughter dates are rare, we literally waited a year to see this movie on opening night, and for a first time experience at an establishment,  I'll be the first one to say they straight suck, and I don't recommend, I will not be back ever.   honestly, regal cinemas never lost my card.

I love being able to choose my seat ahead of time as well.  I recently went to a movie party for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and it was a lot of fun.  Great crowd!  I also like that AD takes moviegoing seriously and does not tolerate talking during a movie or using a cell phone.  This place is for the adults that want to actually see a movie.  I only took a star away because the service can be pretty slow at times.  Last time I was there, I ordered a beer midfilm and it took a little over 20 minutes to get it.  Maybe it was just a rough night."

During the previews and first 10 min of the movie, servers kept hitting my feet as they passed by. Our row was very busy with food service and it became distracting. I ""put up a card"" to alert them of the problem. The manager asked to walk out in the hallway to discuss my problem, while missing more of the movie. The manager seemed more interested in stroking his beard than listening to me.For about 3 min during the movie there was someone in another theater talking on a mic and it was louder than our screen. Several people reported the noise but were met with frustrated staff and not a lot of friendly answers.Gonna give them a break for a while. Maybe longer, we‚Äôll see. üò¢"

Alamo Drafthouse,8/15/2024,Emily Thompson,TRUE,5,"I‚Äôve been watching movies regularly here for about a year. Here are my observations:1. The staff are phenomenal folks. Friendly, willing to help, and have always gotten my snack/drink order correct. Pro tip: you can ask for modifications! Hate green onions? They will leave those off. Just ask nicely.2. Alamo has a system where the waitstaff work ~2 movies, and then their shift is done. As a result, if you are seated in a low-census movie, your server may close you out a bit before last call is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to happen. As a result, it really is best to arrive 30 minutes before the show, to place your order for food or drink right away.Staffing is hard, and people call out. As a result, the remaining staff are present well past their shift end time.3. Your server is going to ask for a card before the movie to put orders on. Alamo really does not like cash. I saw some minors there alone once who *only* had cash, and I think they were able to make it work, but it was hard on the server. I wish Alamo would change this, by at least letting you drop off cash at the counter, and letting you keep a running credit on your account to deduct against.4. They have about ten auditoriums, but only seem to be showing about five movies per day. I hope this is because Sony is investing in this location and renovating the vacant auditoriums.5. There truly are no bad seats in the house, but you need to pick the first four or five rows (between the front screen and the big, wide aisle in the middle of the auditorium) if you would like a recliner.6. Unlike competitors, Alamo runs mostly to schedule. It‚Äôs easier to catch a double feature here than other places, because you can trust that the movie will begin approximately 5-15 minutes after the posted start time, not 35-40 minutes after the posted start. This is good to know if you are a busy person with limited free time."

Alamo Drafthouse,7/15/2024,Ron Beton,TRUE,2,"A beautiful cinema, but that's all. What it's all about is the experience during the film. You order in the hall at a private table and then they bring it to you.  Now we went to Deadpool's 1st weekend. Great movie by the way. Deadpool's popcorn head apparently sold out after just 1 day, which is a really bad thing when the movie doesn't even run for a day.  Taking orders in the dark, from a card. Nice old fasion, but the young man could not manage to bring 2 salty popcorn, 2 milkshakes and 2 cokes. After pressing 5 times, complaining, still ordering, we received the 2nd milkshake after 90 minutes and the drinks were complete.  We never received the 2nd popcorn. Well, the butter that comes with it, thank you!Again, I get the idea and it all sounds really nice. But if you want this to be a success, you really have to do something about the worthless young ministry.  By the way, we are Dutch people passing through, and this is typed in Dutch. üòâ"

The melted cheese was not good . And it was the fake cheese.  It was so much  that it took  away  from  the  other ingredients.The popcorn  came no butter.  Ok so then it took  half  way though  the movie  to get the sour cream.  So the food was cold.Will I be back . Yes but not for the food.Update  the food.

The manager stopped us at the door to ask their ages and after we said our youngest was almost 3, he said we couldn‚Äôt see the show.  When they gave a refund, it was only partial because of ‚Äúbooking fees‚Äù they refused to refund.  The kids were very upset and it ruined the night out with the family.  We realize that if we looked closer we would have seen that the minimum age is 3 for a ‚ÄúKid Friendly‚Äù showing, as we knew they couldn‚Äôt go to an adult show, but the wording really threw us off.  Saying ‚ÄúKid Friendly‚Äù is very misleading and should just say ‚ÄúAges 3+‚Äù instead.

Alamo Drafthouse,12/15/2023,Tyjai.M Richardson,FALSE,1,"My family and I started a new Christmas tradition this year of going to the movies, as my Mom has been dealing with an illness this year and is not able to do as much as before. The Alamo was my first option because I‚Äôve had such awesome experiences at this location.Unfortunately, my little brother was running a bit late as he was traveling from Richmond. I asked the front desk team members about your late policy and was told it was 15mins to ensure interruptions are at a minimal. We were seated at about 10:45 as the movie started at 11am.As the movie started, we notice a continuance of folks arriving - even after 11:15. He arrives about 20mins past the movie start time and was not allowed in. I spoke to the general manager, Cj Roberts, to explain the situation and CJ told us the policy was the policy and to check out a later movie time. I informed him that the tickets were pre purchased weeks in advance and that our entire family was in there. Additionally, folks had been coming in and out the entire time. I was told to get a refund.So, no. After this experience I will no longer recommend an Alamo movie location. I appreciate your hard workers during the holiday season, but given it was Christmas Day, I feel the policy should have been adjusted to reflect traveling delays. I also feel like the reasoning behind the policy is redundant because you have your staff, and an influx of patrons, still walking in and out during the entire movie potentially causing interruptions.My brother had to sit in his car the entire movie to wait for us, as we were having lunch as a family after the movie. We don‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time as a family together as we all live in different parts of the state, so this was our time to spend as a family and it was completely broken up due to this policy. This is unacceptable and The Alamo will no longer be our movie theater of choice, nor get recommended."

We just saw The Marvels and hadn‚Äôt seen the tv show Ms Marvel so we were worried that we‚Äôd be in the dark about some things.

This is the only time I've been angry enough about the service to consider leaving mid-show. Was seeing a LONG show (3 hrs plus) and the server came by not long after I sat down to take my order. Popcorn, drink, please come back in a few minutes once I've had a chance to look over the menu. Popcorn and drink delivered by someone who didn't even stop.All was fine at this point, except then I didn't see anyone else for more than 2 hours, and then only because after at least three unsuccessful attempts to waive the single server down when he was delivering food to other people around me, I followed a server into the side area and asked them to PLEASE have someone come take my (properly written on the card and sticking up as much as possible) order that had been sitting there for 2 hours. 5 minutes later, someone appears and takes my (by this time revised) order, in which I said I no longer had time for a meal, but please refill my popcorn and drink. It took three people for that to happen, and then the server came by offering a free pizza with many apologies, he ""didn't see my card."" Thanks, but no thanks, I don't want to eat it in 20 minutes. When the bill arrived, it included a $10 off card. I'm not sure I'll give them another chance to use it.2 stars because the seats were comfortable, the sound was ok (if loud) and the place was clean. But I can get that and eat popcorn at a less-expensive theater without an hour-long round-trip from my house. Drafthouse is supposed to be a premium experience. Today it wasn't."

This review is only 4 stars and not 5 because we went to watch Killers of the Flower Moon a day ago and the theater left their side lights on. It took me out of the film immersion a bit and I could see the peoples faces around the theater which took me as weird. The last 3 times I‚Äôve been the theater was overly dark. I don‚Äôt know if this is a new thing due to prior complaints of darkness I‚Äôm not aware of, but I prefer the theater feeling. It felt like I was watching the film in an auditorium in high school."

Alamo Drafthouse,9/15/2023,Candice Ryan,FALSE,3,"I used to be able to give Alamo Drafthouse - Charlottesville location five stars but I‚Äôve now downgraded them to three stars.  Without a doubt Alamo drafthouse is the best movie theater I‚Äôve ever been to.  I love the bizarre but well done pre-show before every movie, service is usually very efficient, food decently prepared, and seats comfortable.  What disappoints me now after a year of frequenting this particular theater is the fact that they seem to not show movies I particularly want to see that they do show in Northern VA and much farther locations.  They also seem to focus more on family/kid friendly movies that do come out more so than anything else at yhis location.  Sorry I‚Äôm not traveling two hours to go to another Alamo location.  I understand there may not be enough theaters at this location but if they‚Äôd depend less on movies that have been out for years and maybe prioritze the new ones more (even if only shown for a day or two), would be better.  Lately we‚Äôve been going to the Violet Crown in the downtown mall because they are practically showing all the new movies.  Their menu isn‚Äôt as extensive but is the only alternative for us lately.  If it‚Äôs a matter of buying movie rights, how come it seems Northern VA has but Charlottesville hasn‚Äôt?  In my opinion, this location is doing themselves a disservvice by depending on movie parties showing movies I can easily rent on Amazon Prime video and not have to travel or pay almost $100 for food and service.  Really too bad."

Yep, the Peanut M&Ms are almost always stale. $6 for a half full container of stale candy is a bummer.

He always know when to look and check in on the people who have been there and need refills as well as keep up with the new arrivals and their orders.  I couldn‚Äôt believe how he was able to still manage all this on the busiest night I‚Äôve seen in years."
Alamo Drafthouse,7/15/2023,Michelle,TRUE,5,I love going to the alamo for the reclining seats. Wish they'd change the lighting to make it easier to see the menu better and give the option to turn the light on or off. Other than that it's very comfy and the food is pretty good too.

Alamo Drafthouse,6/15/2023,Sapp,TRUE,5,"Great food, comfortable seats, friendly staff and I just signed up for their ""Season Pass"" which, in my opinion, is one of the best deals any of the movie theaters have for unlimited (with stipulations of course) movies.Edit: 7/14/23. I've had it enough times to be able to confidently say they have one of THE best strawberry shakes I've ever had. And if you like spicy wings, try the new ""reaper"" flavor. I'm an instant fan!

It's the best movie ie experience because you don't have to worry about people talking over the movie. The movie parties are the best because it's the movies you love, props and you can sing along or quote every line."
Alamo Drafthouse,6/15/2023,Kayla Repking,FALSE,2,"First time here, not impressed in the slightest. We called before booking tickets to ask if all the theaters had reclining seats. The chick said yes. She failed to mention that it's only half the seats in the theater and the other half are old, uncomfortable stadium seats that move any time someone else in the row shifts in their seat. The food and drinks are obscenely overpriced. The screens are ridiculously small. Expected more for something with an almost 5 star rating."

He had to flag the server to find out where his beer was and was just told they saw his order like that was the answer. This was half way through the movie. My brother never received his beer and we were there for his birthday.

Alamo Drafthouse,5/15/2023,Chris Hungerford,TRUE,5,We really enjoy the Alamo Drafthouse. It's our go to movie theater in Charlottesville.They have very dim lights which allow you to read the menus and the wait staff will come and deliver food during the movie. So it has the benefit of full food and drink service during the whole movie unlike some dinner movie theaters which only serve food before the movie begins. The only down side is if you find the activity distracted during the movie. It doesn't bother me. I like to be able to order through out the movie.

Thank you for the help.Unfortunately my first time going here with friends and family. It was a nice set up my pizza tasted great. But unfortunately i couldn‚Äôt enjoy the rest of the movie after they messed up me and my sisters receipts at least 3 times. Charged her 60 then 40 and then 30 something. Today me and my friends checked our accounts only to find they took out more for tips than they were supposed to. Supposedly a glitch in taxes not showing up on main receipt I‚Äôm glad I took a picture of mine first. I wish I could say I‚Äôm coming back but never again and already filed a complaint because this is unprofessional and ridiculous. Anyone else that goes here I hope doesn‚Äôt have to go through what we did.

I was visiting from out of town, I wish we had one closer to home.We enjoyed our food, and the drink selection was more extensive than I would have expected. Our servers on both days were fantastic, especially on the first day as he took the time to explain to me how everything worked. I also noted that the picture quality was great. The screen was aligned to the image perfectly and it was crystal clear. It's one of those things that you don't often notice at a theater, but when someone like Alamo nails it, you definitely notice the quality.Clean theaters and bathrooms, loads of parking."

Alamo Drafthouse,3/15/2023,Andrew Davis,FALSE,1,"Pretty cool theater with ok service. However, I was charged for a burger I did not get even though I asked for it twice in writing, no answer.

In regards to their food, I had ordered the monster burger which was okay, I just don‚Äôt think it was worth the price. I thought given their description of the food and the prices, the food would be restaurant style but I and my guests didn‚Äôt get that. The food is a bit overpriced in my opinion.

Alamo Drafthouse,12/15/2022,Jarrod Harris,TRUE,5,"Great experience. The food is and the service. Nice concept. If you don't like eating in the dark or dim light, just get the regular and enjoy the moment. Not all seats recline."

They didn‚Äôt let us in because we can cause ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù. However, I decided to wait for the 2 D that was a hour later.

This place was a picture perfect dinner and a movie date. The food and drinks are good. The chairs are plush and appointed in leather but I wish they reclined instead of just rocking. They have some strict rules for talking and texting during the movie which I appreciate. You get one warning and then you're gone. So be polite and don't talk/text during the movie. The service was the best part. The waiters were friendly and attentive! If you want the full experience (ie movie tickets, alcohol, and food) it is on the expensive side but you pay for what you get. I paid approximately $90 which included the tip for two people. I would definitely recommend this place."

If you want to talk through a movie or be on your phone it is best to stay home than to come to this theater. That is one thing I enjoy about coming to the Alamo is that I know I am going to get to watch a movie in a distraction free theater.

We were enthused with the fact we had just driven 45 mins for NOTHING!

Alamo Drafthouse,2/15/2022,Magdalena Fitz,FALSE,2,"I hope this was a one time thing but my latest visit to the alamo was very disappointing. Everything was fine in the beginning servers came and took our orders and it came out in a timely manor. Sometime passes and i put a card up for a popcorn refill and a drink refill. This was about 20-30 minutes into the movie. An hour or so passes and no one has come out to take the ticket. I wasn‚Äôt the only one with a ticket up, there was about 8 other tables with tickets up and no one had come to take theirs either. A couple minutes later a server comes out taking all the tickets. 20 minutes later nothing had come out. It was not until there was about 10-15 minutes left of the movie everyone received their orders. This is quite frustrating having to rush to finish everything before the movie ends is not fun and it really shouldn‚Äôt have happened. I don‚Äôt know if it was a case of inattentive workers or bad management either way should not have happened. Not only all this but the sever did not bring out the bill until the movie was completely over (credits and bonus short at the end) and people were leaving. I am willing to give the alamo another chance seeing as this was my first bad experience but i hope it doesn‚Äôt happen again."

Gotta say though, I was really annoyed that they literally take 45 minutes to refill your soda, so don't expect to get more than 1 refill - I'm sure that's the idea. Same with popcorn! One of their staff came up to my seat during my movie, I had ""popcorn refill please"" written on my stupid little note card (would have been my FIRST refill), and she holds it up making some gesture, I nod, and she takes it away, never to come back. What gives?"

Really great variety of films including occasional classics from past decades. Their website conveniently shows all the films they're showing, including upcoming stuff and you can buy tickets right from the website. Nice bar area with great beer selection to grab a cold one before or after your movie. I believe they also have trivia night once a week.I recommend ordering whatever you want at the beginning of the movie when they first come over to you because the few times I've tried to order something 30 minutes or more into the movie (like a 2nd beer), it usually takes at least 15 minutes for the server to even notice if they notice it at all. The last time I went I couldn't order anything from the menu because I only had cash on me and the server told me they don't take cash. It would be helpful to mention that somewhere on the website. Other than those couple of things, this is my favorite place to catch a flick in town!"

And the sodas tasted like they're supposed to - ginger ale and coca-cola. The staff is friendly too. I definitely recommend this theater."

She said ""it should still be coming"" . ANother 20 or 30 minutes went by and iputa note asking about my food in the order slot. She said the machine wasbroke and left before I could ask about the pizza assuming she meant shake machine? My friend got billed for two drinks instead of 1 and a refill. I never got any of my order.

It was our first date night  for MONTHS. There were a few things considerably out of synch, yes. However, we had a wonderful server whom I think was probably running from theater to theater. She was beyond lovely. And I hope she knows that. ;) The biggest point of contention was the food. It was subpar. At best. One thing I hope everyone understands within writing reviews ( which I RARELY do) is to and understand that we are all a little underwater right now. Kindness, a big breath and redirecting how you approach things goes a long long way. Read the room. And that goes both ways everyone. Peace and love Alamo. Thankyou!!!!"

Alamo Drafthouse,12/15/2021,Kia Howard,TRUE,3,"This was a very unique experience for me! For me, I had never been to a theatre. I thought it was a lovely concept: sitting down and having someone bring the food and drinks¬† to you. It's really convenient and you avoid the dreaded concession line that's waiting in your typical theater that makes you contemplate ""Is popcorn REALLY worth it?"". Sitting down and situated, I really loved the seats and the stuff that was playing before the previews and movie started (it was stuff regarding to the movie you're watching and interviews and insights that was really cool). Our waiter was a delight. However, as the previews began and new people came in and sit down and had a waiter rush over to accommodate them, I didnt realize the waiters would be frequently catering to people as the cinema experience began. As someone who was all the way in the very back sinking in the environment around me, it was a little distracting. The waiters would try their best throughout the movie to make themselves as scarce as possible when servicing people but as someone with a bird's eye view of both the movie and the people, it was an utter fail. What saved it was that the movie was really loud in a way that brought you back in from what was going on around you and I appreciated that. Also they had this strict ""no noise"" policy that they enforced after the previews and they informed you if had a problem with a chatty neighbor you could inform your waiter and theyd handle the situation for you, which I thought was really neat of them. The popcorn was very good and it was a lovely time aside from all the distractions.¬† I reccomend if you're someone who doesnt like alot of movement or noise during a movie, this will most definitely be a not pleasant time for you. My only wish would have been that they would actively serve you all the way until the movie previews were over and after that, you would have to go for refills and more snacks on your own."

We got there early, sat in our assigned seats and ordered food with our waiter before the movie began. The food came out relatively fast, but I had to ask 3 times for my beverage. By the time I finally got it, my food was cold. The family next to us received an incorrect order and there was a lot of hype going on related to getting it corrected...waitstaff kept coming and standing right in front of us. It was so distracting that we missed the first 15 minutes of the movie. Ugh...what a waste of money. The food was way too expensive for what it was. Definitely not worth it...I've had better quality at local hole-in-the-wall type joints. Next time I want to see a movie, I'll eat at home and just go to a regular theater like Regal."

My experience was the same; it's so comfy, the staff were all friendly and the food is awesome. He loved it, too! I especially love their no talking or disruption policy, their fun yet serious take on the matter and that they WILL escort out noisy neighbors if there are complaints. I think way more theaters should apply the policy! The only complaint I can think of is that the food can get pricy, but it's really good food, so it's well worth it, especially since tickets are a reasonable cost. The movie quality is great, too! I highly recommend this place if you want a top-notch experience at a movie and have cravings for real food rather than just popcorn (though they've got that, too!).

Alamo Drafthouse,8/15/2020,Kaneesha Lord,FALSE,1,"I have been a patron of the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema since they first came to Charlottesville. Two weeks ago, I received the worst service leading to a fraudulent charge on my debit card and interrogation-like questioning from three managers when I requested resolution. The server brought my food to another patron, that patron signed a receipt with my name on it and I was charged for food I did not order or receive. When I first called the manager on duty, they reassured me that after the weekend, they would process my return stating that they worked during the same shift when I saw the film and heard feedback about my server being ""overwhelmed"" during their shift. After 10 phone calls and being passed off to different managers, one finally took my card number to process a refund (11 days after my initial call). No one apologized for the poor service that led to the charge or the time I wasted repeating details of my experience with every manager there. I would encourage each patron to be mindful of how current management disrespects customers and protects their staff even when they are at fault. I do not think the refund will be processed and I will think twice before I step foot in there again."

I left and asked an employee if they could quiet them down. They did send someone, but the chatting continued, and no employee returned to check.

Regal Cinema,5/15/2024,Dean Stafano,TRUE,5,"Comfortable theater. Like most/all things, moving to ""app"" based tickets/etc. Assigned seats are great if you prefer that.

I belong to the Regal Unlimited app...so all of my tickets are bought through the app. Food/drinks are too expensive, so I have no lines to deal with.

Regal Cinema,12/15/2023,M Bullock,TRUE,4,Nice place but as another reviewer stated cash was not an option.  I had to pay for my tickets at a kiosk.  Customers should have the option to pay with cash instead of card because some of us still choose to use cash occasionally as a form of payment that is my only complaint.

Regal Cinema,11/15/2023,Skye King,TRUE,3,We areived exactly on time and still sat through 27 straight minutes of commercials. Mostly for credit cards and cars. The movie we saw was already on streaming. I could have watched it from home with no commercials.The upside is that once the movie started it was a good experience. The sound is good and the picture looks great and I do enjoy the experience of going to the movies and laughing along with friends and strangers. But I'll probably avoid this particular theater if I can help it. No movie is worth 27 minutes of ads.

Regal Cinema,9/15/2023,Eddie Mikell,TRUE,3,"Update: Theater is now closed.It is an ok theater, but they started a new process where you have to choose where you sit when you purchase the tickets.  Slows ticket purchase to a crawl.  There is always a fight that breaks out because someone is in the wrong seat.  The kids that come in to settle the issue aren't big enough to do anything about it, so you end up missing some of the movie because of the yelling and screaming."

Regal Cinema,8/15/2023,Jennie Jen,TRUE,4,It's a decent movie theater. Seats are comfortable. Wheelchair accessible. The concession prices are astronomical. Spent $30 for a medium and large popcorn and a drink. They offer alcohol though so that's a nice option. The staff at concessions is not very friendly and I think employees with long hair need to put their hair up when handling food. Ticket taker was very friendly.

BUT... something happened that almost ruined my movie experience.As I was exiting at the end of the movie, just a few feet past the ticket person who usually ""helps"" direct you to your one of 14 theatres...he demanded to see my ticket because he thought I was trying to enter without one. If he actually did his job instead of socializing with one of his pals, he would have noticed I was exiting not entering the theatre. Instead he chose to challenge me in a disrespectful tone which I reprimanded him for. He, of course said I was the one being disrespectful to which I demanded to speak with his manager. While I was speaking with the manager about his employee's rude and disrespectful manner, this employee was smirking at me... being further disrespectful to me.  I hope management corrects such behavior by explaining the difference between entering and leaving the theatre. Of course that can only be done if the employee is diligent enough to work and keep their eyes open instead of socializing AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ELSE.The customer is not always ""right"", but in this case, disrespect, IS NEVER RIGHT."

The movie looked alright but it wasn't as clear or crisp as it should be for the money you put out. Everything was clean from the lobby to the bathrooms and yes inside where you watch the movie.

The usher that checks the tickets, saw us coming and continued to play a game on his phone. As we approach we waves us over to the chair he is sitting in.

I didn't know this going into it or I would have waited until it hit Netflix. I'm thinking low budget films should have a lower ticket price. Not to mention the picture quality was extremely grainy..."

The theatre seems like it's getting slower and slower and in typical fashion,  instead of being innovative to attract customers,  they've gone and raised the prices and cut staff,  meaning longer lines for more money.

No walk-thru's by the staff. In fact, no staff. Even when we left there were no staff anywhere visible in the building. The place was a total mess, inside and out. It was like a riot had occured in the lobby and outside on the steps and escalators.Staff and customers need some adult supervision. We won't go back.

My daughter's binky fell and when I bent down to grab it under the chairs there was so much popcorn and dust under the seats I could fill a few buckets of large popcorn. I had to move popcorn out my way to get her binky. It looked like your workers swept everything under the seats. Y'all either need to talk to your workers or find better workers because when I went out to talk to someone about it the whole place was empty everyone was gone. Someone needs to be there when customers are still in the building no matter the time. Complete disappointment and never going back. Please if your able to don't waste your money here..

The outside admittedly is a bit more awe-inspiring and daunting than the inside but the actual place itself still offers a lot of room in a well-done, clean setting.

It generally has enough showings for movies that I want to see and there is a wide variety of Refreshments at the concession stand.I have two big problems here, though. First of all, there's almost never anyone in the box office so you have to go to the concession line if you want to buy tickets. There are automated machines, but you can't go through them if you have a disability because the machines don't let you purchase companion seats. This means that if you need an ADA seat you have to go through what is often an incredibly long line to get tickets.The second problem is that I heard they are switching to Pepsi products. That is a major bummer, because my other half will not drink Pepsi but likes to have a Coke during a movie. We will almost certainly have to find another theater as soon as we show up and there is Pepsi on tap. Just so you're aware in case this is likewise a deal-breaker for you."

Regal Cinema,12/15/2019,Cville Gordo,FALSE,1,"This is outrageous, the tickets are sold at concessions instead of the actual box office. Making it so the wait to get tickets and food much slower.

Every one in the concession lines that I talked too were very late for their movie as well.

Regal Cinema,12/15/2019,SR Reynard,TRUE,3,"A large, clean, and modern theater with a good selection of films, and covered parking underneath.  If your previous experience with IMAX theaters involved a massive screen, like at the Smithsonian, you will find that the IMAX screen here is regular-sized with a little curvature; not worth the extra $5.

The doors were locked even though the stated operating hours were listed as: from 11 AM to 11 PM.  The front lights were off but the interior lights were on and there was staff moving around inside.  They ignored us and another lady standing outside.   It was cold but we braved another five minutes rattling the locked doors in hopes of attracting the staff.  They could see us but ignored us.  We left and went to another theatre.  The callous attitude of the staff and the failure to open per stated policy on line and on doors dictate it will be a long time (if ever) that we return.

Using  the kiosks do not allow you touse your Regal rewards card. Using concessions forces you to stand in very long lines even if you don't want to wait the time for popcorn.  Yes this basically creates more revenue for Regal. However, the lines are becoming so long you  have to arrive so early. I think there greed will just cause me to rent a movie at home"

Service at concessions is painfully slow. I regularly see people leave the concession line because they are tired of waiting or their movie is starting. I've missed the beginning of several movies after a 15-20 min wait in line. When you pay over $20 for a large popcorn (usually stale) and a large soda so that you can get a refill, you shouldn't have to miss 15 minutes of your movie to get that refill. Alamo, of course, has in seat service, and Violet Crown has a soda machine by the door for refills. Should have a dedicated line for refills at the very least, if not implement a better system so that the line moves faster."

Regal Cinema,3/15/2019,Anja Reyes,TRUE,2,"Beautiful theater, horrible service. As a regal employee myself, I was extremely disappointed with management and the staff. Staff seemed to not even want to be there and the manager who was ringing up my tickets, he said my card didn't exist when it worked initially at the concession. Seemed hostile and when I went back to concessions he said my discount didn't work because it was only at my theater and was rude about it. I knew this wasn't true seeing how I have used it at other locations and when we had gotten popcorn, the concessions worker gave us popcorn with a lot of crumbs ((you can tell where there's crumbs as you scoop the popcorn)) and little to no butter. Popcorn was stale and no popcorn salt was available. Extremely disappointed and the only reason I'm giving two stars is because the theater was beautiful, clean, and the area is nice due to restaurants near by for dinner and a movie. After working at my theater with friendly staff, great management who aren't rude to customers or employees to other locations it was just disappointing and a horrible experience."

Maybe I have been unlucky when watching these movies, but for the second time in a row, I had to got to the front and mention that the 3d  movie was not synching with the glasses. Fortunately, we were not to much into the movie that they restarted and reset the synching. It would be nice if someone would check this while the 3d trailers are on before the main show begins."
Regal Cinema,3/15/2019,Steve Sikora,TRUE,5,This is a very nice place with many cinema viewing rooms. The admission and concessions are reasonably priced and will not put you in the poor house. This was one of the few places actually playing Apollo 11.

Sometimes, however, the machine will allow you to win several ducks. Myself, I won 3 ducks on my first play. One of the ducks is just like a regular brown duck with red chest, but the other two are pretty sweet. One is a green blocky duck, like it's from minecraft, and the other is a yellow duck with a green surfboard. Please see the attched photograph for details. All in all, a great experience for movie lovers and duck fanatics alike. 6/5 stars."

Tickets are the same price or cheaper.I also dislike them making you select your seats when you buy the ticket at the counter at Regal, it slows down the purchasing time tremendously."
