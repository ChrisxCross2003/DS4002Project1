Not many folks in our theater showing Conclave . . . My wife loved her buttered popcorn. Made fresh!

The staff was super friendly, professional, and accommodating after a sudden (and very badly timed) storm took out the electricity for half of downtown just before the Wicked early access showtime last night.

They claim to have two bars, but neither serve liquor- only beer and wine. I did like that the theatre was smaller and the seats where comfortable. If you sit front row they recline! All in all ok, but I wouldn't be excited to visit again.  $60 for two people and that didn't include any food is OVERPRICED.  Especially with how easy it is to rent movies over the internet for nominal fees, and how quickly movies become available.   Do yourself a favor and go to a nice dinner on the downtown mall instead.

Friendly, willing to help, and have always gotten my snack/drink order correct. Pro tip: you can ask for modifications! Hate green onions? They will leave those off. Just ask nicely.2. Alamo has a system where the waitstaff work ~2 movies, and then their shift is done. As a result, if you are seated in a low-census movie, your server may close you out a bit before last call is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to happen. As a result, it really is best to arrive 30 minutes before the show, to place your order for food or drink right away.Staffing is hard, and people call out. As a result, the remaining staff are present well past their shift end time.3. Your server is going to ask for a card before the movie to put orders on. Alamo really does not like cash. I saw some minors there alone once who *only* had cash, and I think they were able to make it work, but it was hard on the server. I wish Alamo would change this, by at least letting you drop off cash at the counter, and letting you keep a running credit on your account to deduct against.4. They have about ten auditoriums, but only seem to be showing about five movies per day. I hope this is because Sony is investing in this location and renovating the vacant auditoriums.5. There truly are no bad seats in the house, but you need to pick the first four or five rows (between the front screen and the big, wide aisle in the middle of the auditorium) if you would like a recliner.6. Unlike competitors, Alamo runs mostly to schedule. It‚Äôs easier to catch a double feature here than other places, because you can trust that the movie will begin approximately 5-15 minutes after the posted start time, not 35-40 minutes after the posted start.

The Alamo was my first option because I‚Äôve had such awesome experiences at this location.Unfortunately, my little brother was running a bit late as he was traveling from Richmond. I asked the front desk team members about your late policy and was told it was 15mins to ensure interruptions are at a minimal. We were seated at about 10:45 as the movie started at 11am.As the movie started, we notice a continuance of folks arriving - even after 11:15. He arrives about 20mins past the movie start time and was not allowed in. I spoke to the general manager, Cj Roberts, to explain the situation and CJ told us the policy was the policy and to check out a later movie time. I informed him that the tickets were pre purchased weeks in advance and that our entire family was in there. Additionally, folks had been coming in and out the entire time. I was told to get a refund.So, no. After this experience I will no longer recommend an Alamo movie location. I appreciate your hard workers during the holiday season, but given it was Christmas Day, I feel the policy should have been adjusted to reflect traveling delays. I also feel like the reasoning behind the policy is redundant because you have your staff, and an influx of patrons, still walking in and out during the entire movie potentially causing interruptions.My brother had to sit in his car the entire movie to wait for us, as we were having lunch as a family after the movie. We don‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time as a family together as we all live in different parts of the state, so this was our time to spend as a family and it was completely broken up due to this policy.

I love the bizarre but well done pre-show before every movie, service is usually very efficient, food decently prepared, and seats comfortable.  What disappoints me now after a year of frequenting this particular theater is the fact that they seem to not show movies I particularly want to see that they do show in Northern VA and much farther locations.  They also seem to focus more on family/kid friendly movies that do come out more so than anything else at yhis location.  Sorry I‚Äôm not traveling two hours to go to another Alamo location.  I understand there may not be enough theaters at this location but if they‚Äôd depend less on movies that have been out for years and maybe prioritze the new ones more (even if only shown for a day or two), would be better.  Lately we‚Äôve been going to the Violet Crown in the downtown mall because they are practically showing all the new movies.  Their menu isn‚Äôt as extensive but is the only alternative for us lately.  If it‚Äôs a matter of buying movie rights, how come it seems Northern VA has but Charlottesville hasn‚Äôt?  In my opinion, this location is doing themselves a disservvice by depending on movie parties showing movies I can easily rent on Amazon Prime video and not have to travel or pay almost $100 for food and service.

Alamo Drafthouse,12/15/2021,TRUE,3,"This was a very unique experience for me! For me, I had never been to a theatre. I thought it was a lovely concept: sitting down and having someone bring the food and drinks¬† to you. It's really convenient and you avoid the dreaded concession line that's waiting in your typical theater that makes you contemplate ""Is popcorn REALLY worth it?"". Sitting down and situated, I really loved the seats and the stuff that was playing before the previews and movie started (it was stuff regarding to the movie you're watching and interviews and insights that was really cool). Our waiter was a delight. However, as the previews began and new people came in and sit down and had a waiter rush over to accommodate them, I didnt realize the waiters would be frequently catering to people as the cinema experience began. As someone who was all the way in the very back sinking in the environment around me, it was a little distracting. The waiters would try their best throughout the movie to make themselves as scarce as possible when servicing people but as someone with a bird's eye view of both the movie and the people, it was an utter fail. What saved it was that the movie was really loud in a way that brought you back in from what was going on around you and I appreciated that. Also they had this strict ""no noise"" policy that they enforced after the previews and they informed you if had a problem with a chatty neighbor you could inform your waiter and theyd handle the situation for you, which I thought was really neat of them. The popcorn was very good and it was a lovely time aside from all the distractions.¬† I reccomend if you're someone who doesnt like alot of movement or noise during a movie, this will most definitely be a not pleasant time for you. My only wish would have been that they would actively serve you all the way until the movie previews were over and after that, you would have to go for refills and more snacks on your own.",0.186164,0.530596

The server brought my food to another patron, that patron signed a receipt with my name on it and I was charged for food I did not order or receive. When I first called the manager on duty, they reassured me that after the weekend, they would process my return stating that they worked during the same shift when I saw the film and heard feedback about my server being ""overwhelmed"" during their shift. After 10 phone calls and being passed off to different managers, one finally took my card number to process a refund (11 days after my initial call). No one apologized for the poor service that led to the charge or the time I wasted repeating details of my experience with every manager there.

I've almost been hit 3 times crossing that spot due to reckless drivers...",-0.093353175,0.317757937
