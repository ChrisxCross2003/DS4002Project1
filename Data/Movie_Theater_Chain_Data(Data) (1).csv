The staff was super friendly, professional, and accommodating after a sudden (and very badly timed) storm took out the electricity for half of downtown just before the Wicked early access showtime last night. We were attending with family who had already driven in from Richmond, and were so disappointed to arrive to a dark theater.  But the staff let us come into the restaurant space and assured us they were committed to showing the movie if the power came back on.  In the end, we had a fun time waiting (with fingers crossed) and ultimately got to see a great movie and enjoy fresh popcorn!",

Each of which is relatively unique from the others and all of which are worth visiting. But the Violet Crown is my favorite of the three. Why? Because the Violet Crown is all about the movies. Having been here for two seasons of movies, I can tell you there are very few films that don't make an appearance here.  Any given year, you can catch blockbusters, indie movies, Oscar movies, documentaries, and older movies they decide to put back in theaters. I had one of my favorite movie theater experiences ever watching the 2017 Oscar Nominated Animated Short Films screening. One of the reasons being that the rest of the audience was so respectful of everyone else and yet clearly having a good time watching the show. You can't ask for more.Add on to that a good food selection, a great beer selection, seats you can book online in advance, and a friendly and helpful staff and you have a terrific theater going experience. Treat yourself to a show at the Violet Crown!",

You get the opportunity to reserve seats for a theater that is typically much smaller than the ones we've become accustomed to. But they have all new technology so the picture and sound is great. There is also an attached restaurant and bar so if you want to take food or beer or wine into the movie you are more than welcome to. One of the other great things is that with parking being a hassle on the downtown mall, you can park at the parking garage and get your parking receipt validated at the theater!",

We recently attended the moana 2 party and were so surprised when we arrived to activities and little gifts. This was such a fun addition to the viewing experience. The food is pretty good for a dining movie theatre and I love that they do bottomless popcorn and drinks. My only small critique is that the seats are not the most comfortable and not all the seats recline. If they had updated seats and recliners for all chairs this would be a 5 star for me. Overall though would definitely recommend over any of the other movie theaters in charlottesville.,

Here are my observations:1. The staff are phenomenal folks. Friendly, willing to help, and have always gotten my snack/drink order correct. Pro tip: you can ask for modifications! Hate green onions? They will leave those off. Just ask nicely.2. Alamo has a system where the waitstaff work ~2 movies, and then their shift is done. As a result, if you are seated in a low-census movie, your server may close you out a bit before last call is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to happen. As a result, it really is best to arrive 30 minutes before the show, to place your order for food or drink right away.Staffing is hard, and people call out. As a result, the remaining staff are present well past their shift end time.3. Your server is going to ask for a card before the movie to put orders on. Alamo really does not like cash. I saw some minors there alone once who *only* had cash, and I think they were able to make it work, but it was hard on the server. I wish Alamo would change this, by at least letting you drop off cash at the counter, and letting you keep a running credit on your account to deduct against.4. They have about ten auditoriums, but only seem to be showing about five movies per day. I hope this is because Sony is investing in this location and renovating the vacant auditoriums.5. There truly are no bad seats in the house, but you need to pick the first four or five rows (between the front screen and the big, wide aisle in the middle of the auditorium) if you would like a recliner.6. Unlike competitors, Alamo runs mostly to schedule. It‚Äôs easier to catch a double feature here than other places, because you can trust that the movie will begin approximately 5-15 minutes after the posted start time, not 35-40 minutes after the posted start. This is good to know if you are a busy person with limited free time.",

Nice old fasion, but the young man could not manage to bring 2 salty popcorn, 2 milkshakes and 2 cokes. After pressing 5 times, complaining, still ordering, we received the 2nd milkshake after 90 minutes and the drinks were complete.  We never received the 2nd popcorn.

The Alamo was my first option because I‚Äôve had such awesome experiences at this location.Unfortunately, my little brother was running a bit late as he was traveling from Richmond. I asked the front desk team members about your late policy and was told it was 15mins to ensure interruptions are at a minimal. We were seated at about 10:45 as the movie started at 11am.As the movie started, we notice a continuance of folks arriving - even after 11:15. He arrives about 20mins past the movie start time and was not allowed in. I spoke to the general manager, Cj Roberts, to explain the situation and CJ told us the policy was the policy and to check out a later movie time. I informed him that the tickets were pre purchased weeks in advance and that our entire family was in there. Additionally, folks had been coming in and out the entire time. I was told to get a refund.So, no. After this experience I will no longer recommend an Alamo movie location. I appreciate your hard workers during the holiday season, but given it was Christmas Day, I feel the policy should have been adjusted to reflect traveling delays. I also feel like the reasoning behind the policy is redundant because you have your staff, and an influx of patrons, still walking in and out during the entire movie potentially causing interruptions.My brother had to sit in his car the entire movie to wait for us, as we were having lunch as a family after the movie. We don‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time as a family together as we all live in different parts of the state, so this was our time to spend as a family and it was completely broken up due to this policy. This is unacceptable and The Alamo will no longer be our movie theater of choice, nor get recommended.",

It took three people for that to happen, and then the server came by offering a free pizza with many apologies, he ""didn't see my card."" Thanks, but no thanks, I don't want to eat it in 20 minutes.

Without a doubt Alamo drafthouse is the best movie theater I‚Äôve ever been to.  I love the bizarre but well done pre-show before every movie, service is usually very efficient, food decently prepared, and seats comfortable.  What disappoints me now after a year of frequenting this particular theater is the fact that they seem to not show movies I particularly want to see that they do show in Northern VA and much farther locations.  They also seem to focus more on family/kid friendly movies that do come out more so than anything else at yhis location.  Sorry I‚Äôm not traveling two hours to go to another Alamo location.  I understand there may not be enough theaters at this location but if they‚Äôd depend less on movies that have been out for years and maybe prioritze the new ones more (even if only shown for a day or two), would be better.  Lately we‚Äôve been going to the Violet Crown in the downtown mall because they are practically showing all the new movies.  Their menu isn‚Äôt as extensive but is the only alternative for us lately.  If it‚Äôs a matter of buying movie rights, how come it seems Northern VA has but Charlottesville hasn‚Äôt?  In my opinion, this location is doing themselves a disservvice by depending on movie parties showing movies I can easily rent on Amazon Prime video and not have to travel or pay almost $100 for food and service.  Really too bad.",

Yep, the Peanut M&Ms are almost always stale. $6 for a half full container of stale candy is a bummer.

Everything was fine in the beginning servers came and took our orders and it came out in a timely manor. Sometime passes and i put a card up for a popcorn refill and a drink refill. This was about 20-30 minutes into the movie. An hour or so passes and no one has come out to take the ticket. I wasn‚Äôt the only one with a ticket up, there was about 8 other tables with tickets up and no one had come to take theirs either. A couple minutes later a server comes out taking all the tickets. 20 minutes later nothing had come out. It was not until there was about 10-15 minutes left of the movie everyone received their orders. This is quite frustrating having to rush to finish everything before the movie ends is not fun and it really shouldn‚Äôt have happened. I don‚Äôt know if it was a case of inattentive workers or bad management either way should not have happened. Not only all this but the sever did not bring out the bill until the movie was completely over (credits and bonus short at the end) and people were leaving.

Nice bar area with great beer selection to grab a cold one before or after your movie. I believe they also have trivia night once a week.I recommend ordering whatever you want at the beginning of the movie when they first come over to you because the few times I've tried to order something 30 minutes or more into the movie (like a 2nd beer), it usually takes at least 15 minutes for the server to even notice if they notice it at all. The last time I went I couldn't order anything from the menu because I only had cash on me and the server told me they don't take cash. It would be helpful to mention that somewhere on the website.

For me, I had never been to a theatre. I thought it was a lovely concept: sitting down and having someone bring the food and drinks¬† to you. It's really convenient and you avoid the dreaded concession line that's waiting in your typical theater that makes you contemplate ""Is popcorn REALLY worth it?"". Sitting down and situated, I really loved the seats and the stuff that was playing before the previews and movie started (it was stuff regarding to the movie you're watching and interviews and insights that was really cool). Our waiter was a delight. However, as the previews began and new people came in and sit down and had a waiter rush over to accommodate them, I didnt realize the waiters would be frequently catering to people as the cinema experience began. As someone who was all the way in the very back sinking in the environment around me, it was a little distracting. The waiters would try their best throughout the movie to make themselves as scarce as possible when servicing people but as someone with a bird's eye view of both the movie and the people, it was an utter fail. What saved it was that the movie was really loud in a way that brought you back in from what was going on around you and I appreciated that. Also they had this strict ""no noise"" policy that they enforced after the previews and they informed you if had a problem with a chatty neighbor you could inform your waiter and theyd handle the situation for you, which I thought was really neat of them. The popcorn was very good and it was a lovely time aside from all the distractions.¬† I reccomend if you're someone who doesnt like alot of movement or noise during a movie, this will most definitely be a not pleasant time for you. My only wish would have been that they would actively serve you all the way until the movie previews were over and after that, you would have to go for refills and more snacks on your own.",

I think way more theaters should apply the policy! The only complaint I can think of is that the food can get pricy, but it's really good food, so it's well worth it, especially since tickets are a reasonable cost. The movie quality is great, too!

Two weeks ago, I received the worst service leading to a fraudulent charge on my debit card and interrogation-like questioning from three managers when I requested resolution. The server brought my food to another patron, that patron signed a receipt with my name on it and I was charged for food I did not order or receive. When I first called the manager on duty, they reassured me that after the weekend, they would process my return stating that they worked during the same shift when I saw the film and heard feedback about my server being ""overwhelmed"" during their shift. After 10 phone calls and being passed off to different managers, one finally took my card number to process a refund (11 days after my initial call). No one apologized for the poor service that led to the charge or the time I wasted repeating details of my experience with every manager there. I would encourage each patron to be mindful of how current management disrespects customers and protects their staff even when they are at fault. I do not think the refund will be processed and I will think twice before I step foot in there again.",

Mostly for credit cards and cars. The movie we saw was already on streaming. I could have watched it from home with no commercials.The upside is that once the movie started it was a good experience. The sound is good and the picture looks great and I do enjoy the experience of going to the movies and laughing along with friends and strangers. But I'll probably avoid this particular theater if I can help it. No movie is worth 27 minutes of ads.,

If he actually did his job instead of socializing with one of his pals, he would have noticed I was exiting not entering the theatre. Instead he chose to challenge me in a disrespectful tone which I reprimanded him for. He, of course said I was the one being disrespectful to which I demanded to speak with his manager. While I was speaking with the manager about his employee's rude and disrespectful manner, this employee was smirking at me... being further disrespectful to me.  I hope management corrects such behavior by explaining the difference between entering and leaving the theatre.

No walk-thru's by the staff. In fact, no staff. Even when we left there were no staff anywhere visible in the building. The place was a total mess, inside and out. It was like a riot had occured in the lobby and outside on the steps and escalators.Staff and customers need some adult supervision. We won't go back.

It generally has enough showings for movies that I want to see and there is a wide variety of Refreshments at the concession stand.I have two big problems here, though. First of all, there's almost never anyone in the box office so you have to go to the concession line if you want to buy tickets. There are automated machines, but you can't go through them if you have a disability because the machines don't let you purchase companion seats. This means that if you need an ADA seat you have to go through what is often an incredibly long line to get tickets.The second problem is that I heard they are switching to Pepsi products. That is a major bummer, because my other half will not drink Pepsi but likes to have a Coke during a movie. We will almost certainly have to find another theater as soon as we show up and there is Pepsi on tap. Just so you're aware in case this is likewise a deal-breaker for you.",

The reason? Service at concessions is painfully slow. I regularly see people leave the concession line because they are tired of waiting or their movie is starting. I've missed the beginning of several movies after a 15-20 min wait in line. When you pay over $20 for a large popcorn (usually stale) and a large soda so that you can get a refill, you shouldn't have to miss 15 minutes of your movie to get that refill. Alamo, of course, has in seat service, and Violet Crown has a soda machine by the door for refills. Should have a dedicated line for refills at the very least, if not implement a better system so that the line moves faster.",

As a regal employee myself, I was extremely disappointed with management and the staff.

Seemed hostile and when I went back to concessions he said my discount didn't work because it was only at my theater and was rude about it. I knew this wasn't true seeing how I have used it at other locations and when we had gotten popcorn, the concessions worker gave us popcorn with a lot of crumbs ((you can tell where there's crumbs as you scoop the popcorn)) and little to no butter. Popcorn was stale and no popcorn salt was available. Extremely disappointed and the only reason I'm giving two stars is because the theater was beautiful, clean, and the area is nice due to restaurants near by for dinner and a movie. After working at my theater with friendly staff, great management who aren't rude to customers or employees to other locations it was just disappointing and a horrible experience.",

You pay 1 dollar and you play until you win a duck. Sometimes, however, the machine will allow you to win several ducks. Myself, I won 3 ducks on my first play. One of the ducks is just like a regular brown duck with red chest, but the other two are pretty sweet. One is a green blocky duck, like it's from minecraft, and the other is a yellow duck with a green surfboard. Please see the attched photograph for details. All in all, a great experience for movie lovers and duck fanatics alike. 6/5 stars.",
